Cabin Baggage
You can carry one cabin bag (56 cm x 36 cm x 23 cm) and one small bag (40 cm x 30 cm x

pre-book up to 40 kg to avoid extra fees. Each bag should weigh no more than 32 kg. If
you're travelling with others on the same booking, you can combine your baggage
allowances.
For Xpress Lite bookings on domestic flights, the first 15 kg costs INR 1500 per person and
for international flights, the first 20 kg costs INR 2000 at the airport. Also, remember that if
your booking is in non-INR currency, the baggage price might vary at the airport.

When packing your bags, please keep in mind the items that are prohibited from being
carried and the regulations on the carriage of liquids, aerosols and gels.
Guests must carry Portable Mobile Chargers and Power Banks in their hand baggage as
